# Yelp Camp using Reactjs, react-router and Express back-end

React + react-router + Vite + Express
Yelp Camp remade with React front-end and React-router

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Progress tracking
### DONE:
- Set up connection from express to react
- Set up the first working data fetch, from server (not including database)

### TO DO NEXT:
